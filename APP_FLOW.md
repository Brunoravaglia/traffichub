# App Flow

## Public
1. Home (`/`)
2. Utilities hub (`/utilidades`) and tool pages
3. Pricing, Features, FAQ, Blog, About, Support
4. Auth entry: Login (`/login`), SignUp (`/signup`)

## Authenticated
1. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
2. Client operations (`/clientes`, `/novo-cliente`, checklist, reports)
3. Team operations (`/gestores`, `/novo-gestor`)
4. Productivity and operational pages (calendar, saldo forecast, templates)

## UX Priorities
- First 5 seconds on Home: value proposition + primary CTA.
- Utilities: fast scan, immediate route to tool, optional inline help.
- Blog: editorial browsing with strong featured article and clear filtering.
